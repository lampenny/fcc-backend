# URL Shortener Microservice

This microservices utilises `sessionStorage` to store data as setting a database is not needed for such a small project.

### Get started

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ node server.js`
3. go to `localhost` and enter a url e.g. `https://www.google.co.jp/`
4. on the response page, append the `short_url` id to the end of `http://localhost:3000/api/shorturl`
